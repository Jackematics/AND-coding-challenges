# Hllo Worl

My solution for hllo worl with both stretch goals completed in Ruby. My solution returns a single value rather than a list of all possible values. 

## How to Run

Open main.rb in the challenge-9-hllo-worl folder in VS Code (or any other Ruby IDE), run ruby main.rb in the terminal (with terminal path challenge-9-hllo-worl) and the solution should appear in the terminal. To test different input values, on line 19 change the get_longest_word array paramter to contain whichever letters of the alphabet you like, as long as it is lower case.
