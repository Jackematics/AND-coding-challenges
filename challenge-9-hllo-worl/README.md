# Hllo Worl

My solution for hllo worl with both stretch goals completed in Ruby. My solution returns a single value rather than a list of all possible values. 

## How to Run

Open main.rb in the challenge-8-roman-numerals folder in VS Code (or any other Ruby IDE) and run ruby main.rb in the console and the solution should appear in the console. To
test different input values, on line 19 change the get_longest_word array paramter to contain whichever letters of the alphabet you like, as long as it is lower case.
