# Connect Four

My solution for the Connect Four coding challenge completed in Node, Typescript and React with all stretch goals completed. This was a big timesink for me and the code represents my steady descent into laziness. I started off with TDD and diligently refactored, then I gave up when the tests became tedious. My code turned into a spaghetti mess which I'm not exactly happy with but it got the job done.

## How to run

`npm run start` and the app should run on http://localhost:3000
`npm run test` to run the tests (the ones I didn't get too lazy to write)
Enjoy

## The Challenge

Connect Four is a two-player board game where both players pick a colour (Red or Yellow) and take turns dropping their coloured discs into the top of a 7x6 grid. The first to connect four discs of the same colour is the winner. The challenge this week is to implement a game of Connect Four. Running the game against these sample sets of moves should output the correct winner. If the game is over before the set of moves ends, the game should ignore the remaining moves and return the rightful winner.

### Rewards:

:four: Points are awarded for outputting the correct winner for each sample game
:three: Further points are awarded for visualising the game on screen (either a proper UI, or as some kind of console-art)
:three: Further points are awarded for creating an interactive game which can be played against a basic computer player
