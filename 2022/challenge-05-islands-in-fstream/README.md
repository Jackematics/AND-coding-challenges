# Islands in fstream

My solution to the Islands in fstream coding challenge completed in JavaScript with all stetch goals completed. Initially I completed it in Typescript but switched to JavaScript so I could fudge the < 1000 bytes stretch goal.

## How to run

`npm run start` and the solutions to the challenge input and stretch goal input will be printed to the console \
`npm run test` to run the tests \

## The Challenge

This is a map of a desert island, where each '1' represents a cell of dry land, and each '0' represents a cell of ocean. The task is to determine the total perimeter of the island (i.e. total length of cell edges touching water), where each cell has edges of length 1. For example, an isolated land cell without any neighbouring land cells would have a total perimeter of 4 - although the provided map doesn't actually contain any cases of this.

### Rewards:

:five: Points are awarded for determining the correct perimeter of the example island \
:three: Further points are awarded for an algorithm capable of returning the perimeters of multiple islands in this problem \
:two: Further points are awarded for an algorithm in under 1000 bytes of code \
