# Word Buckets

My solution for the Word Buckets coding challenge completed in node with typescript. The algorithm works for all the sample problems and I have a full set of unit tests, not really sure how to check if my solution was under 500 bytes of code so I just ignored it; maybe it will be under who knows. I think it took longer to figure out how to set up a typescript project from scratch than it did actually coming up with the solution, pain.

## How to run

Do an npm install in the root of the project. I've added the sample problem solutions into the tests but you can see the results by either doing 

`npm run start`, 

or see the results of the tests by running

`npm run test`
