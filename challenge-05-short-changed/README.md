# Short Changed

Finished program for the Short Changed coding challenge, including both stretch goals.

## How To Run

This is a python program, the sample transactions are already plumbed in so all you need to do is run the program and it will print the result for you. If you want to add any more 
test transactions, copy the print statement of another transaction and swap the transaction parameters out (apologies for the horrendous method chaining, I lost the will to 
refactor or tidy the code up).
