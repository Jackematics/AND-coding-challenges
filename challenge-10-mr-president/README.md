# Mr President

My solution for the Mr President challenge with all stretch goals done in python (as long as nobody else picks python). My solution returns all the dates where the most number of presidents were alive, as well as the number of presidents for a couple of extra brownie points. I used no if statements (just the ternary conditional), so it looks ugly as hell. No apologies though it's a strange stretch goal.

## How to Run

This is a python program, the csv data is parsed automatically so all you need to do is run the program in your preferred IDE (I use VS Code) and it will print the result for you.
