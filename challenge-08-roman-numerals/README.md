# Challenge VIII

My solution for challenge VIII, with main challenge and stretch goal completed. I was a bit confused on what subtractive notation was exactly, my take was:

* I can be placed before V (5) and X (10) to make 4 and 9.
* X can be placed before L (50) and C (100) to make 40 and 90.
* C can be placed before D (500) and M (1000) to make 400 and 900.

Otherwise, use additive notation. So IIX != 8, use VIII instead.

## How to Run

Open solution.py in the challenge-8-roman-numerals folder in VS Code (or any other Python IDE) and run the program, the solution will appear in the console.
