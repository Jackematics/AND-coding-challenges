# Hllo Worl

My solution for hllo worl with both stretch goals completed in Ruby. My solution returns a single value rather than a list of all possible values. 

## How to Run

Open main.rb in the challenge-9-hllo-worl folder in VS Code (or any other Ruby IDE), run ruby main.rb in the terminal (with terminal path challenge-9-hllo-worl) and the solution should appear in the terminal. To test different input values, on line 19 change the get_longest_word array paramter to contain whichever letters of the alphabet you like, as long as it is lower case. 

## The Challenge

Youâ€™re typing out a message to a colleague on Slack when suddenly disaster strikes :ohno: - you knock a cup of coffee all over your keyboard, rendering many of the keys inoperative. Given a list of keys on the keyboard which are still working, the challenge is to write a program which can determine the longest English-language word you can type using those letters. A dictionary of words can be found here. Some key sets may have multiple solutions - returning the first is acceptable, although feel free to return a list of all solutions.
:five:  Points are awarded for a working solution  
:three:  Points are awarded for a solution which takes under 1 second to return its result  
:two:  Points are awarded for a solution in under 100 lines of code  

### Example:
Given the following letters:
hewsda
The expected output is:
deadheaded (or also hasheeshes)
