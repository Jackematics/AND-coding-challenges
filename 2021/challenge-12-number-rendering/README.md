# Number Rendering

My solution for the Number Rendering coding challenge with all stretch goals completed in python. 

## How to Run

Open solution.py in your preferred python IDE (I use VS Code), and run it with F5. You can test different strings of numbers (you should only pass in a string, I haven't done error 
handling) by adding print statements to the bottom of the file.
