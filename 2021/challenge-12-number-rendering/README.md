# Number Rendering

My solution for the Number Rendering coding challenge with all stretch goals completed in python. 

## How to Run

Open solution.py in your preferred python IDE (I use VS Code), and run it with F5. You can test different strings of numbers (you should only pass in a string, I haven't done error 
handling) by adding print statements to the bottom of the file.

## The Challenge

Given any whole integer number, your task this week is simply to output the number to the console in the traditional LCD “calculator font”. You shouldn’t use any external libraries to achieve this.

### Example:
Given the number 123456789, the expected output might look like this:
  _  _     _  _  _  _  _
| _| _||_||_ |_   ||_||_|
||_  _|  | _||_|  ||_| _|
