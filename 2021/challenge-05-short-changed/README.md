# Short Changed

Finished program for the Short Changed coding challenge, including both stretch goals.

## How To Run

This is a python program, the sample transactions are already plumbed in so all you need to do is run the program and it will print the result for you. If you want to add any more 
test transactions, copy the print statement of another transaction and swap the transaction parameters out (apologies for the horrendous method chaining, I lost the will to 
refactor or tidy the code up).

## The Challenge

Paramjit has opened a small store selling a variety of snacks and candy bars. Business is great, but he decides itâ€™s time to apply some technology to the store to reduce the amount of effort required when making sales. Given a set of coins/notes in his cash register and some sample transactions, your task is to write a program to calculate the smallest number of coins/notes needed to give back the correct amount of change.
:six:  Points are awarded for a working calculator.  
:two:  Points are awarded for a solution capable of also returning the largest possible number of coins/notes (i.e. least efficient)  
:two:  Points are awarded for a solution in under 50 lines of [non-minified] code
