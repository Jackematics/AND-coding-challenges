# Codings A Blast

My solution for the Codings A Blast coding challenge. I didn't create an interactive UI for it, and I have no idea if the language is unique but the core logic for bomb defusal

## How to Run

Open the challenge-7-codings-a-blast folder in your preferred Java IDE and run the program, the solution will appear in the console.
