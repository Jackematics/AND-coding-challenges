# snake
Recreation of the old mobile game Snake using canvas in JavaScript.

You'll need to run this against a local server to get this running (otherwise you'll get a CORS errors). This is how I've done it in VS Code:
1. Get the Live Server extension from the extensions marketplace in VS code
2. Navigate to game.html in the src folder
3. Click F1, then Live Server: Open with Live Server
4. A tab should now open with the game on your default browser
